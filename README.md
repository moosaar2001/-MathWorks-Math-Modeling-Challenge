# M3 Challenge 2022 Project

## Overview
Welcome to the M3 Challenge 2022 project! This repository contains our team's submission for the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (M3 Challenge) for the year 2022.
Our team tackled "Remote Work: Fad or Future".

The M3 Challenge is an annual contest where high school students use mathematical modeling to solve real-world problems within a limited timeframe.
Our team dedicated time and effort over the weekend to create a mathematical model, analyze the problem, propose solutions, and communicate our findings in a written report.

## Features
- Mathematical model development for the presented prompt:
    "Of the jobs that are remote-ready, can we predict whether individual workers will be permitted to work remotely, and who
    will choose to do so? For a given city or metro area, can we predict the percentage of workers who will go remote?."
- Analysis of real-world data.
- Proposed solutions and insights derived from the mathematical model.


## Usage
To explore our project:
